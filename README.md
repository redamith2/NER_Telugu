# NER_Telugu
Deep Learning Algos for Named Entity Recognition in Telugu Language

# ANN 1

Contains scripts for data preprocessing, Neural Network Training and Precision/ recall measurement, on one-hot vectors of each work in a window size of 5. 

The middle word is the target word, and the remaining 4 are used as context words


# Pre-generated word vectors 
For pregenerated word vectors refer to Facebook word2vec models on wikipedia data https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText

# ANN 2

Contains scrips for Training Neural networks on already generated word2vec models generated by facebook.


# Clustering 

The output of the NN2.py code is determined by the number of clusters formed as a result of n-gram clustering (Brown Clustering). The code is availabe at this link https://github.com/mheilman/tan-clustering where it is used on raw-text of data.
